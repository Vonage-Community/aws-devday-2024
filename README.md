This repository is to be used with the Vonage/AWS Hackday 2024 hackathon. You will use this code
to set up a basic video calling server that will record a video call, and then upload it to an 
S3 bucket. The video call will be transcribed and summarized by Amazon Transcribe and Amazon Bedrock,
and the summarization will be e-mailed to you.
